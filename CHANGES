Version 0.01 -- First stable release
Version 0.02 -- Changed my email in the pod docs
Version 0.10 -- Year calculation has been redone to better match Tolkien's.
	This should only break compatibility if you were storing shire dates
	to disk somewhere.
	Some minor changes to the POD to make it format prettier
Version 0.11 -- Added as_string and used it to overload the "" operator.
	Thanks to Michael Schwern for this idea.
	Also, the code Michael sent me got me thinking about the order dates
	were displayed in, and after some thought I decided to change it to
	day then month.  This is a really minor change, but it there.
